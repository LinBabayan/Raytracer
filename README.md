### The goal of this project is to implement ray-tracing rendering.

The computer-generated image is generated by calculating the intersection of rays with the surfaces of objects in the 3D scene, described by their geometry and material. At each intersection point, a lighting simulation is performed, resulting in a color that radiates in the direction of the ray.
